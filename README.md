# Exploratory Analysis 
Based on dataset I was curious on do prices of books vary according to reviews written by customers on page. So I plot the graph between average reviews and price.

After seeing this I was sure that it pretty much doesn't vary with the reviews given. 

One obvious question arises in mind that do the price also vary on the size of book i.e. length of book?

After seeing the graph it is clear that it does vary with the length of book and the relation is almost linear. 

If someone wanted to start reading about Data Science he/she should start from learning basic python. 
So based on average reviews and no. of reviews I categorized the data to give out the books which contained the word python.

The answer came out to be Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition

Then should learn about basic Machine Learning. Hence figured out the best ML book.
